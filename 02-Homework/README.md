# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.



### Additional Specifcations

1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._
   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Pro Tip: Use the [What Font](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) Chrome Extension for calculating Typographic Properties
   Fonts:
   * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * Use a picture of yourself.
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:
   * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Background Images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

6. Dimensions:
   * Pro Tip: Use the Dimensions[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dimensions/baocaagndhipibgklemoalmkljaimfdj?hl=en] Chrome Extension for calculating pixel width and height on wireframes
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html).

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
 Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Reference the bootstrap documentation on Sticky Footers).
   * Give the Footer the following CSS:
   * border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;
   * Sticky Footer with Vanilla CSS - [Sticky Footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).
   


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
